## Announcement
**A new v0.4.0 release of lm-evaluation-harness is available** !

New updates and features include:

- Internal refactoring
- Config-based task creation and configuration
- Easier import and sharing of externally-defined task config YAMLs
- Support for Jinja2 prompt design, easy modification of prompts + prompt imports from Promptsource
- More advanced configuration options, including output post-processing, answer extraction, and multiple LM generations per document, configurable fewshot settings, and more
- Speedups and new modeling libraries supported, including: faster data-parallel HF model usage, vLLM support, MPS support with HuggingFace, and more
- Logging and usability changes
- New tasks including CoT BIG-Bench-Hard, Belebele, user-defined task groupings, and more

Please see our updated documentation pages in `docs/` for more details.

Development will be continuing on the `main` branch, and we encourage you to give us feedback on what features are desired and how to improve the library further, or ask questions, either in issues or PRs on GitHub, or in the [EleutherAI discord](https://discord.gg/eleutherai)!

## Overview

This project provides a unified framework to test generative language models on a large number of different evaluation tasks.

**Features:**
- Over 60 standard academic benchmarks for LLMs, with hundreds of subtasks and variants implemented.
- Support for models loaded via [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/) (including quantization via [AutoGPTQ](https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ)), [GPT-NeoX](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox), and [Megatron-DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/Megatron-DeepSpeed/), with a flexible tokenization-agnostic interface.
- Support for fast and memory-efficient inference with [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm).
- Support for commercial APIs including [OpenAI](https://openai.com), and [TextSynth](https://textsynth.com/).
- Support for evaluation on adapters (e.g. LoRA) supported in [HuggingFace's PEFT library](https://github.com/huggingface/peft).
- Support for local models and benchmarks.
- Evaluation with publicly available prompts ensures reproducibility and comparability between papers.
- Easy support for custom prompts and evaluation metrics.

The Language Model Evaluation Harness is the backend for 🤗 Hugging Face's popular [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard), has been used in [hundreds of papers](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&authuser=2&cites=15052937328817631261,4097184744846514103,1520777361382155671,17476825572045927382,18443729326628441434,14801318227356878622,7890865700763267262,12854182577605049984,15641002901115500560,5104500764547628290), and is used internally by dozens of organizations including NVIDIA, Cohere, BigScience, BigCode, Nous Research, and Mosaic ML.

## Install

To install the `lm-eval` package from the github repository, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness
cd lm-evaluation-harness
pip install -e .
```

We also provide a number of optional dependencies for extended functionality. A detailed table is available at the end of this document.

## Basic Usage

### Hugging Face `transformers`

To evaluate a model hosted on the [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) (e.g. GPT-J-6B) on `hellaswag` you can use the following command (this assumes you are using a CUDA-compatible GPU):

```bash
lm_eval --model hf \
    --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B \
    --tasks hellaswag \
    --device cuda:0 \
    --batch_size 8
```
### Speculative Decoding Test with Huggingface `transformers`

To evaluate the speculative decoding performance of model pairs on the [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) (e.g. meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf and JackFram/llama-160m) on tasks `openbookqa,gsm8k,coqa,truthfulqa` you can use the following command (this assumes you are using a CUDA-compatible GPU):

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 lm_eval --model sd \
    --model_args pretrained=meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf,draft=JackFram/llama-160m,temperature=0.6,top_p=1.0,width=4\
    --tasks openbookqa,gsm8k,coqa,truthfulqa\
    --device cuda:0 \
    --batch_size 1 \
    --limit 0.1 \
```

### Current Limitations and Instructions (v0.2)

- [ ] CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES must be assigned.
- [ ] Batch size must be 1.
- [ ] Tensor parallelism is not supported. When CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES is assigned with more than 1 GPU, pipeline parallelism is activated.
- [ ] Multiple drafts are sampled with "Sampling without replacement" as described in [Sequoia](https://infini-ai-lab.github.io/Sequoia-Page/)
